1. Spring is a framework which is used to build enterprise web applications.

2. Spring boot is also a framework that builds on top of Spring. Spring boot offers extra functionalities on top of Spring.
One important features is autoconfiguration. In Spring, we need to do a lot of configurations with XML or annotations.
However, Spring boot offers autoconfiguration which save developers a lot of time spent on these configurations.
Basically, it provides a read-made application which is more convenient and robust.

3. Spring platform

4. Spring boot is one of the modules in Spring platform.
Spring platform also includes many other modules such as Spring data, Spring security, Spring cloud...

5. Dependency Injection is basically a way to create an instance without having to use 'new' keyword.
For example in Spring boot application, we have a controller & service classes, which we need to call the service class
in the controller class. In this situation, we can use @Autowired private CustomerService customerService;.
This Spring will create a bean(instance) of the actual CustomerService in our controller class.
Then, we can access CustomerService's attributes and methods from its class in our controller class.

6. Inversion of Control (IoC) is a design pattern in which inverts the traditional flow of control. Instead of developers
call the methods or libraries, framework is responsible for those actions.
Inversion of Control (IoC) is a fundamental principle in Spring Framework. Therefore, it allows Spring to manage the lifecycle
and dependencies of the components in your application.
